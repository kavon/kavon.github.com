============

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a first year PhD student in Computer Science at the 
[University of Chicago](http://cs.sites.uchicago.edu/).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am interested in programming languages and their implementations,
although I dabble in topics that fall within the theory of computation as well. I am currently tackling
issues related to concurrent programming.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you would like to know more about my academic or work experience, here's a [CV](cv.pdf).
