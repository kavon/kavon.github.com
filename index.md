============

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a first year PhD student in the [Department of Computer Science](http://cs.uchicago.edu/) at the 
[University of Chicago](http://uchicago.edu/).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am interested in programming languages and their implementations, e.g. compilers,
although I dabble in topics that fall within the theory of computation as well. I am currently tackling
issues in parallel computing.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My email is `[my first name]@cs.uchicago.edu` . If you would like to know more about my academic or work experience, [here's a CV](files/cv.pdf).
